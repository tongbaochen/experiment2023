1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:05,375
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:11,840
(Ross:)I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

3
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:14,300
-She didn't pass away.
-What?

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,139
-My mother's still alive.
-Oh, thank God!

5
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:25,812
(Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter:)It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's a tough old bird.

6
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,689
(Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter:)Are you close with her?

7
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:32,485
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time..

8
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:35,905
in the laundry room.

9
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:38,742
You speak Dutch?

10
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:48,960
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

11
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,922
So she's really not dead.

12
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:56,468
No. She's hanging in there.

13
00:00:56,676 --> 00:01:06,033
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?
